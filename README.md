# Katawa Shoujo Portmaster
Unofficial Katawa Shoujo for Anbernic RG35XX


Hi guys! I recently ported Katawa Shoujo on Anbernic RG35XX via Portmaster
Now this is a test build. Game starts but performance is bad. I'm going to optimize this port for better FPS.
Tested on latest MuOS build on Anbernic RG35XX H.

Problems:

1. Bad performance. Startup is long, intro-video not shows, FPS is low
2. Language support will be added later
3. Input config should be adjusted.
4. Not tested on other Roms (KNULLI, Stock, etc.)

This is my first post there, I'm not a programmer or smth and I take no credit, I'm just a gamer with some computer skills and ChatGPT.
