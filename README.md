# Katawa Shoujo – PortMaster Edition

**Ren'Py 8.3.4 – squashfs build**  
**Tested on Anbernic RG35XX H running MuOS firmware**

---

## ❯ Overview

This is an experimental port of *Katawa Shoujo* to Ren'Py 8.3.4, packaged in squashfs format for use with PortMaster.

The game **launches successfully** and appears to be **fully playable**. No major errors have been observed during testing. Available languages include:  
- English  
- Japanese  
- Spanish  
- French  
- Russian  

**Save system** works.  
**Fast-forwarding** works.  
The game **does not crash** during normal gameplay.  
**R18 content** is present.

---

## ❯ Known Issues

- R18 content **cannot be disabled** at the moment.  
- **Performance is suboptimal**, but acceptable for a visual novel.  
- **Long startup time.**  
- **Controls need refinement** (navigation may feel clunky).  
- **Video playback is broken**: audio plays, but screen remains black (possibly related to `gl4es` rendering).

## ❯ Notes

This port is based on:  
- The Ren'Py 8.0.3 version of Katawa Shoujo by [gcammisa](https://github.com/gcammisa/KatawaShoujo-RenPy8)  
- The PortMaster version of *Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk*

I do **not** claim full authorship of this port. I'm not a programmer or developer — just a gamer with some basic computer skills and the help of ChatGPT.

At the moment, this port is **not available in the official PortMaster catalog**, as I believe it still needs polishing and stability improvements. I may consider submitting it in the future once it's more refined.

If you care about this game and have experience with Ren'Py or porting to ARM devices, **any help is welcome**. Please reach out or submit an issue/pull request if you'd like to contribute.
